## Dependency Manager

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. It has over 44 thousand libraries and is used in over 3 million apps. CocoaPods can help you scale your projects elegantly.

We used :
- [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) - An HTTP Networking in Swift
- [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) - A library for downloading and caching images from the web.
- [Hue](https://github.com/hyperoslo/Hue) - A tools for the colors
- [Firebase](https://cocoapods.org/pods/Firebase) - Simplify your iOS development, grow your user base, and monetize more effectively with Firebase services.

## Documentation

We decided to use [Jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy) for the documentation of our project. This allows to generate extensive documentation. This is in the "Document" folder.


## Requirements

- iOS 11
- Xcode 9.3
- Swift 4.1
- Portrait mode only

## Architecture

We decided to use the [MVVM architecture](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh848246.aspx). MVVM is an architecture and a design method used in software engineering.
Appeared in 2004, MVVM is originally from Microsoft and adapted for application development. This method allows, like the model MVC (model-view-controller), to separate the view of logic and access to data by emphasizing the principles of binding and event.
