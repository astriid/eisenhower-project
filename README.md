## Dependency Manager

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. It has over 44 thousand libraries and is used in over 3 million apps. CocoaPods can help you scale your projects elegantly.

We used :
- pod ['Alamofire'](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) - An HTTP Networking in Swift 
- pod ['Kingfisher'](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) - A library for downloading and caching images from the web.
- pod ['Hue'](https://github.com/hyperoslo/Hue) - A tools for the colors
- pod ['Firebase/Core'](https://cocoapods.org/pods/Firebase) - Simplify your iOS development, grow your user base, and monetize more
effectively with Firebase services.
- pod ['DZNEmptyDataSet'](https://github.com/Xiaoye220/EmptyDataSet-Swift) - A drop-in UITableView/UICollectionView superclass category for showing empty datasets whenever the view has no content to display. DZNEmptyDataSet with Swift.
